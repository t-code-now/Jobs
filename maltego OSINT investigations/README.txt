README FOR MALTEGO INFOGRAPHIC TUTORIALS:

1.the tutorials are pointing for everyone -- they are made with the mind-set of 
reaching out to different types of people – from a cyber security professional 
to the regular explorer in the web.

2.I have added in some tutorials in image of a man with 2 hands open – 
By pressing 'the man' it will redirect the user for an explanation and extension on a different webpage. (the pdf needed to be downloaded first) - 
It meant to have for some people more explanation about different concepts
And subject's that not always known for all 


HOPE THAT YOU WILL ENJOY THE TUTORIALS AND FIND THEM USEFULL 
IF SO HOPE FOR YOUR STAR ON THE REPO 
PLEASE SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS –
I LOVE TO HEAR THEM AND LEARN MORE!
